# Owner Command Logic

## Path normalization

1. The input `--file` path is normalized to a project-relative, forward-slash path via `normalizeProjectRelativePath` (resolves absolute paths, strips trailing slashes, normalizes separators).
2. The normalized path is further cleaned by `normalizeForMatch`: backslashes replaced with forward slashes, trailing slashes removed.

## Mapping comparison algorithm

1. Iterate all graph nodes and their normalized mapping paths.
2. **Exact match:** If the file path equals a mapping path exactly, return immediately with that node as owner.
3. **Prefix match (longest wins):** If the file path starts with a mapping path followed by `/`, record it as a candidate. Among all prefix matches, the one with the longest mapping path wins (most specific owner).
4. If no match found, return `{ nodePath: null }` indicating no graph coverage.

The algorithm guarantees that deeper (more specific) mappings take precedence over broader ones, and exact matches always win over prefix matches.
