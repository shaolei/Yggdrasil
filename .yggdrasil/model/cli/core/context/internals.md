## Logic

# Context Builder Logic

5-step deterministic assembly. Order is fixed; each step appends layers.

## Sequence

1. **Global** — config.yaml: stack, standards
2. **Hierarchy** — collectAncestors from node.parent up to root; for each ancestor, filter artifacts by config, build hierarchy layer
3. **Own** — node.yaml (read from disk) + filtered artifacts
4. **Relational** — for each relation: structural (uses/calls/extends/implements) → buildStructuralRelationLayer (consumes, failure, structural_context artifacts); event (emits/listens) → buildEventRelationLayer
5. **Flows** — flows where node or ancestor in flow.nodes; for each flow: flow artifacts
6. **Aspects** — union of aspect ids from hierarchy + own + flow layers (expanded via implies); for each resolved aspect, check `node.meta.aspect_exceptions` for a matching entry and pass any exception note to `buildAspectLayer`

Implementation note: steps 4–5 execute before step 6 internally so that flow-propagated aspect ids can be collected. buildSections reorders the output to match the spec: Global → Hierarchy → OwnArtifacts → Aspects → Relational (which merges structural deps, events, and flows).

## Output

- `layers`: array of ContextLayer
- `sections`: grouped by key (Global, Hierarchy, OwnArtifacts, Aspects, Relational). Relational merges structural dependencies, events, and flows.
- `tokenCount`: estimateTokens(fullText) — ~4 chars per token
- `mapping`: if node has mapping, add "Materialization Target" to own layers

## Structural vs Event Relations

- STRUCTURAL_RELATION_TYPES: uses, calls, extends, implements
- EVENT_RELATION_TYPES: emits, listens

Structural relations get interface/errors from target (structural_context). Event relations get event name + consumes.

## Aspect Exceptions

When building aspect layers, the builder checks `node.meta.aspect_exceptions` for each resolved aspect. If an exception entry matches the aspect id, the exception's `note` is passed to `buildAspectLayer`, which appends it to the aspect content as a warning block. This prevents aspect generalizations from masking node-specific deviations (e.g., a node that awaits a call where the aspect says fire-and-forget).

`buildAspectLayer` also includes aspect metadata in the output when present: stability tier (from `aspect.stability`) as a "Stability tier" line. This appears after the artifact content and before the exception note. Code anchors are no longer part of `AspectDef` — they live in `node.yaml` under `anchors` and are validated by `cli/core/validator` (E019, W014) rather than included in context output.

## Constraints

# Context Builder Constraints

- **Layer assembly order is fixed:** The 5-layer sequence is: (1) Global config, (2) Hierarchy ancestors root-to-parent, (3) Own node artifacts, (4) Relational dependencies and events, (5) Flows then Aspects. This order is invariant and determines context precedence.
- **structural_context gates relational inclusion:** For structural relations (uses, calls, extends, implements), only artifacts marked `structural_context: true` in config are included from the dependency target. If no structural artifacts exist, all configured artifacts fall back.
- **Context assembly is read-only:** `buildContext` never modifies the graph, node artifacts, or any files. It reads the in-memory graph and node artifact files, then assembles a `ContextPackage`.
- **Aspect expansion detects cycles:** The `expandAspects` function tracks a recursion stack and throws if an aspect implies cycle is detected (e.g., A implies B implies A).
- **Flow participation is transitive through hierarchy:** A node participates in a flow if the node itself or any of its ancestors is listed in the flow's `nodes` array.

## Decisions

# Context Builder Decisions

**Five layers in that specific order:** The assembly proceeds from most general (global config: project name, stack, standards) to most specific (relational context for direct dependencies). Each layer adds precision without repeating the previous. Global sets the project frame, hierarchy provides domain context, own artifacts define the node itself, relational context describes integration points, and aspects add cross-cutting requirements.

**structural_context flag gates relational inclusion:** Without this flag, every dependency would include all its artifacts in the consuming node's context, causing excessive token usage. The flag allows config.yaml to declare which artifacts (e.g., interface.md, errors.md) carry the integration-relevant information. Only those are included for structural relations. If no structural artifacts exist on the target, all configured artifacts are included as fallback.
