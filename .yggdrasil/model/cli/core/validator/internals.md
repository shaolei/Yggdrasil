## Logic

# Validator Logic

## validate(scope)

1. **Early errors**: configError → E012; nodeParseErrors → E001
2. **Config-dependent checks** (if !configError): checkNodeTypes, checkAspectsDefined, checkAspectIds, checkAspectIdUniqueness, checkImpliedAspectsExist, checkImpliesNoCycles, checkRequiredAspectsCoverage, checkAnchorPresence, checkRequiredArtifacts, checkInvalidArtifactConditions, checkContextBudget, checkHighFanOut
3. **Graph-structure checks**: checkRelationTargets, checkNoCycles, checkMappingOverlap, checkMappingPathsExist, checkBrokenFlowRefs, checkFlowAspectIds, checkDirectoriesHaveNodeYaml, checkShallowArtifacts, checkUnpairedEvents
4. **Scope filter**: if scope !== 'all', filter issues by nodePath; validate scope exists

## Key rules

- **checkSchemas**: REQUIRED_SCHEMAS = ['node','aspect','flow']; present = Set(graph.schemas.map(s => s.schemaType)); missing → W010
- **checkNoCycles**: DFS with WHITE/GRAY/BLACK; cycles involving blackbox tolerated
- **checkImpliedAspectsExist**: each id in aspect.implies must have corresponding aspect → E016
- **checkImpliesNoCycles**: DFS on aspect implies graph; cycle → E017
- **checkRequiredAspectsCoverage**: node type with required_aspects; coverage via direct aspect or resolveAspects → W011
- **checkRequiredArtifacts**: artifactRequiredReason evaluates required (always | never | when conditions)
- **checkContextBudget**: buildContext per node; compare tokenCount to warning/error thresholds
- **checkAnchorPresence**: For each node with aspect entries containing `anchors`, validates W014 — each anchor string must appear in at least one mapped source file. Uses `expandMappingToFiles` helper to recursively collect files from mapping paths (skips dotfiles and `node_modules`). All source files for a node are read once and searched for each anchor string via simple `content.includes(anchor)`. E018 (invalid-aspect-exception) and E019 (invalid-anchor-ref) were removed — the unified aspects format makes structurally invalid references impossible.

## Order of checks

Config-dependent first (need valid config). Structure checks can run with partial config. Scope filter applied last.

## Decisions

# Validator Decisions

**Stable error codes E001-E019, W001-W014:** Each validation rule has a fixed code (E for errors, W for warnings). These codes are machine-readable identifiers stable across versions, enabling CI pipelines and automation to match on specific codes rather than fragile message text. New rules receive the next available code.

**Warnings do not block build-context:** Warnings (W-codes) indicate quality suggestions such as shallow artifacts, high fan-out, or missing optional coverage. Errors (E-codes) indicate structural integrity failures such as broken relations, missing yg-node.yaml, or cycles. Only errors represent states where the graph is structurally invalid. build-context operates on the loaded graph and does not consult validation results, so warnings never prevent context assembly.

**W005 message wording:** W005 (budget-warning) message explicitly says "do not delete knowledge from artifacts to reduce size" and directs agents to split nodes. Chose directive wording over neutral suggestion because the original neutral phrasing ("Consider splitting the node or reducing dependencies") was interpreted by agents as permission to delete artifact content, destroying irrecoverable knowledge. The message is an agent behavioral nudge — it guides the action taken in response to the warning.
