export const AGENT_RULES_CONTENT = `# Yggdrasil - System Semantic Memory (Operating Manual)

You are working in a repository managed by Yggdrasil.
Yggdrasil is a persistent, structured semantic memory graph stored in \`.yggdrasil/\`. It maps the repository, dictates system rules, and assembles implementation contexts.

**Why:** AI agents degrade with project size — too little context breaks contracts, too much context drowns in noise. The graph is persistent semantic memory: agents need exactly the right tokens for the task, not the whole repo. Small, precise context beats massive noisy. A repository with Yggdrasil is self-aware.

THIS PROMPT IS YOUR ENTIRE OPERATING MANUAL. Read it carefully. Follow it strictly.

## 0. ATOMIC INVARIANT — OVERRIDES EVERYTHING

**CODE ↔ GRAPH ARE ONE.**
- Code changed → graph artifacts MUST be updated IN THE SAME RESPONSE. No exceptions.
- Graph changed → source files MUST be verified/updated IN THE SAME RESPONSE. No exceptions.
- There is NO "code-only" response. There is NO "graph-only" response (unless explicitly a dry-run plan).
- If you complete a response and one side is changed but the other is not, you have VIOLATED the core contract of Yggdrasil.

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. **Graph First, Always:** Before answering a question, modifying code, or planning a feature, you MUST consult the graph.
2. **Context is Sufficient:** If you feel the need to randomly explore source files to understand what a node should do, the graph is incomplete. **Fix the graph** (add decisions, interface details, constraints). Do not bypass the graph by reading raw code.
3. **Graph is Intended Truth:** If the code and graph diverge, the graph is the truth. If a code change is deliberate, update the graph to match.
4. **Exhaustive Coverage:** Every source file MUST belong to exactly one graph node. No orphaned files.
5. **Tools Read, You Write:** The \`yg\` CLI tools only read, validate, and manage metadata. YOU must create and edit graph directories, \`.yaml\` files, and \`.md\` artifacts manually.
6. **English Only for Artifacts:** All graph artifact files (filenames from \`config.artifacts\`, in the same directory as \`node.yaml\`) MUST be written in English. Conversation can be in the user's language.
7. **Never Touch Operational Metadata:** NEVER manually edit \`.yggdrasil/.drift-state\` or \`.yggdrasil/.journal.yaml\`.
8. **Ask, Never Infer:** If graph and code diverge in a way with multiple valid resolutions, or if a required decision is ambiguous — STOP. State the ambiguity. List interpretations. Ask the user to decide. Never silently choose. Never patch without confirmation. When you stop, always explain the context and available options clearly so the user can make an informed choice.

## 1.5 FAILURE STATES

You have fundamentally broken Yggdrasil if you do any of the following:
- ❌ You modified source code without having run \`yg owner --file <path>\` for each modified file in the SAME response.
- ❌ You modified source code without updating graph artifacts in the SAME response.
- ❌ You modified graph files without verifying/updating source code alignment in the SAME response.
- ❌ You resolved a code↔graph inconsistency without asking the user first.
- ❌ You created or edited a graph element without reading its schema in \`.yggdrasil/templates/\`.
- ❌ You ran \`yg drift-sync\` before updating graph artifacts.
- ❌ You ran \`yg drift-sync\` after a graph-only change without verifying source files.
- ❌ You used Blackbox coverage for greenfield/new code.
- ❌ You answered a question about a mapped file/area without running \`yg build-context\` when the path was known.

---

## 2. CONVERSATION LIFECYCLE (YOUR HABITS)

You do not need explicit "session" commands. Follow these conversational triggers:

### A. Preflight (First message of the conversation)
Always execute these commands before doing anything else. *(Exception: If the user's request is clearly read-only, run ONLY step 1).* **Read-only** means the user asks only for explanation, clarification, analysis, or evaluation — no code or graph modification will occur. Examples: "explain this", "evaluate X", "what does Y do?", "analyze Z". If unsure, run full preflight.
1. \`yg journal-read\` -> If entries exist, consolidate them into the graph, then \`yg journal-archive\`.
2. \`yg drift\` -> If **drift** (code changed, graph baseline stale): run \`yg drift-sync\` for each affected node. Do NOT ask the user — they do not need to know this step. If **missing** or **unmaterialized**: report and ask the user how to proceed.
3. \`yg status\` -> Report graph health.
4. \`yg validate\` -> If W008 stale-knowledge appears, update the knowledge artifacts to reflect current node state.

### B. Answering Questions (When a specific file or area is known)
When the user asks a question and you know (or can infer) which file or area of the codebase it concerns:
1. Run \`yg owner --file <path>\` for the relevant file(s).
2. **If owner FOUND:** Run \`yg build-context --node <node_path>\` and base your answer on that context. Do NOT answer from grep/search alone — the graph provides intent, constraints, and relations that yield better answers.
3. **If owner NOT FOUND:** The file is outside the graph (e.g. third-party code, user's theme/plugin, unmapped area). You may answer from grep/search, but state that the answer is not graph-based.

This applies even when you are **not modifying files** — e.g. when providing code snippets to paste elsewhere, explaining behavior, or suggesting hooks. If the question touches mapped code, build-context first.

### C. Session Verification (Wrap-up)
Triggered by phrases like: "we're done", "wrap up", "that's enough", "done", "ok".
**Note: The graph should ALREADY be up to date. If the graph requires massive updates at this stage, YOU HAVE FAILED.**
1. If iterative journal mode was used: consolidate notes to the graph, then \`yg journal-archive\`.
2. \`yg drift\` -> If drift detected, run \`yg drift-sync\` for each affected node. Do NOT ask — absorb automatically.
3. \`yg validate\` -> Fix any structural errors.
4. Report exactly what nodes and files were changed.

## 3. WORKFLOW: MODIFYING OR CREATING FILES (Code-First)

You are NOT ALLOWED to edit or create source code without establishing graph coverage first.

**Gate:** Before using any tool that modifies files, you MUST have run \`yg owner --file <path>\` for each file you intend to modify. If you have not — run it first, then proceed. No exceptions. Gate applies to **source files** (files outside \`.yggdrasil/\`). For graph files (\`.yggdrasil/model/\`, \`.yggdrasil/aspects/\`, etc.), follow the Graph Modification Checklist in section 4 instead.

**Step 1: Check coverage** -> Run \`yg owner --file <path>\`

**Step 2: If Owner FOUND (The Execution Checklist)**
Whenever you write or edit source code, you MUST output this exact checklist in your response to the user, and execute each step BEFORE finishing your turn:

- [ ] 1. Read Specification (ran \`yg build-context\`)
- [ ] 2. Modify Source Code
- [ ] 3. Sync Graph Artifacts (manually edit the node's artifact files IMMEDIATELY to match new code behavior)
- [ ] 4. Baseline Hash (ran \`yg drift-sync\` ONLY AFTER updating the graph)

**Step 3: If Owner NOT FOUND (Uncovered Area)**
STOP. Do not modify the code. First determine: **Is this greenfield or existing code?**

* **If GREENFIELD (empty directory, new project):** Do NOT offer blackbox. Create proper nodes (reverse engineering or upfront design) before implementing.
* **If PARTIALLY MAPPED (file is unmapped, but lives inside a mapped module):** Stop and ask the user if this file should be added to the existing node or if a new node is required.
* **If EXISTING CODE (legacy, third-party):** Present the user with 3 options and wait:
  * **Option 1: Reverse Engineering:** Create/extend standard nodes to map the area fully before modifying.
  * **Option 2: Blackbox Coverage:** Create a \`blackbox: true\` node to establish ownership without deep semantic exploration.
  * **Option 3: Abort/Change Plan:** Do not touch the file.

**Reverse engineering order:** When reverse-engineering an area, create graph elements in this order: (1) aspects, (2) flows, (3) knowledge elements, (4) model nodes. Never create model nodes before cross-cutting rules and shared wisdom exist — they depend on them.

---

## 4. WORKFLOW: MODIFYING THE GRAPH & BLAST RADIUS (Graph-First)

When adding features, changing architecture, or doing graph-first design:

1. **Check Blast Radius:** Before modifying a node that others depend on, run \`yg impact --node <node_path> --simulate\`. Report the impact to the user.
2. **Read Config & Templates:**
   * Check \`.yggdrasil/config.yaml\` for allowed \`node_types\` and \`tags\`.
   * **CRITICAL:** ALWAYS read the schema in \`.yggdrasil/templates/\` for the element type (node.yaml, aspect.yaml, flow.yaml, knowledge.yaml) before creating or editing it.
3. **Validate & Fix:** Run \`yg validate\`. You must fix all E-codes (Errors).
4. **Token Economy & W-codes:**
   * W005/W006: Context package too large. Consider splitting the node.
   * W008: Stale semantic memory. Update knowledge artifacts.

**Graph Modification Checklist**
Whenever you change the graph structure or semantics, you MUST output and execute this exact checklist:

- [ ] 1. Read schema from \`.yggdrasil/templates/\` (node.yaml, aspect.yaml, flow.yaml, or knowledge.yaml for the element type)
- [ ] 2. Edit graph files (\`node.yaml\`, artifacts)
- [ ] 3. Verify corresponding source files exist and their behavior matches updated artifacts
- [ ] 4. Validate (ran \`yg validate\` — fix all Errors)
- [ ] 5. Baseline Hash (ran \`yg drift-sync\` ONLY AFTER steps 2-3 are confirmed)

**Journaling (Iterative Mode Scope):**
* **Default:** Write changes directly to graph files immediately. Do not defer.
* **Opt-in:** ONLY if the user says "use iterative mode" or "use journal". Once activated, it remains active for the ENTIRE conversation until wrap-up. Use \`yg journal-add --note "..."\` to buffer intent.

---

## 5. PATH CONVENTIONS (CRITICAL)

To avoid broken references (\`E004\`, \`E005\`), use correct relative paths:
* **Node paths** (used in CLI, relations, flow nodes): Relative to \`.yggdrasil/model/\` (e.g., \`orders/order-service\`).
* **File paths** (used in mapping, \`yg owner\`): Relative to the repository root (e.g., \`src/modules/orders/order.service.ts\`).
* **Knowledge paths** (used in node explicit refs): Relative to \`.yggdrasil/knowledge/\` (e.g., \`decisions/001-event-sourcing\`).

---

## 6. GRAPH STRUCTURE, CONFIG & TEMPLATES CHEAT SHEET

The graph lives entirely under \`.yggdrasil/\`. You NEVER guess structure. You MUST ALWAYS read the corresponding schema reference in \`.yggdrasil/templates/\` before creating or editing any graph file.

* **\`.yggdrasil/config.yaml\`**: Defines \`node_types\`, \`tags\`, \`artifacts\`, \`knowledge_categories\`.
* **\`.yggdrasil/templates/\`**: Schemas for each graph layer — \`node.yaml\`, \`aspect.yaml\`, \`flow.yaml\`, \`knowledge.yaml\`.
* **\`.yggdrasil/model/\`**: Node tree. Each node is a directory with \`node.yaml\` and artifact files.
* **\`.yggdrasil/aspects/\`**: Cross-cutting rules. Directory contains \`aspect.yaml\` and \`.md\` content.
* **\`.yggdrasil/flows/\`**: End-to-end processes. Directory contains \`flow.yaml\` and \`.md\` content.
* **\`.yggdrasil/knowledge/\`**: Repo-wide wisdom. Directory contains \`knowledge.yaml\` and \`.md\` content.

---

## 7. CONTEXT ASSEMBLY & KNOWLEDGE DECONSTRUCTION (HOW TO MAP FILES)

Your ultimate goal when describing a file or node is **Context Reproducibility**. A future agent reading ONLY the output of \`yg build-context\` for this node must be able to perfectly reconstruct the source code's behavior, constraints, environment, and purpose.

However, you must NOT dump all knowledge into a single file. Yggdrasil's context package is **multi-layered** and hierarchically assembled. When you map existing code or design new code, you must deconstruct the knowledge and place it at the correct abstraction layer so the engine can mechanically reassemble it.

### CRITICAL RULE: CAPTURE INTENT, BUT NEVER INVENT IT
The graph is not just a structural map; it is the semantic meaning of the system. Code explains "what" and "how". The graph MUST explain "WHY".

1. **ALWAYS Capture the User's "Why":** If the user explains the business reason, intent, or rationale behind a request (e.g., "We need to do X because Y"), you MUST permanently record this reasoning in the relevant graph artifacts (from \`config.artifacts\` that fit the content). Do not let the conversation context evaporate.
2. **NEVER Invent the "Why":** Artifacts that imply human judgment (e.g. local decisions, \`knowledge/invariants\`) must reflect ACTUAL human choices.
3. **NO Hallucinations:** You MUST NEVER infer or hallucinate a rationale, an architectural decision, or a business rule.
4. **Ask if Missing:** If the user requests a significant architectural or business logic change but does not provide the rationale, you MUST ask them "Why are we making this change?" before documenting the decision in the graph.

When mapping a file, execute this mental routing:

### Layer 1: Unit Identity (Local Node Artifacts)
* **What goes here:** Things exclusively true for this specific node.
* **Routing:** **DO NOT ASSUME FILE NAMES.** You MUST read \`.yggdrasil/config.yaml\` (the \`artifacts\` section) to see the exact allowed filenames for the current project and their requirement conditions (e.g., \`required: always\` vs \`when: has_incoming_relations\`). Write local node knowledge ONLY into these configured files next to \`node.yaml\`.
* For each artifact in \`config.artifacts\`, use its \`description\` to decide what content belongs there. Create optional artifacts (those with \`required: never\`) when the node has matching content. Extract from source; do not invent.

**Subagents:** When mapping a node, for each optional artifact in config, ask: "Does the source contain content matching this artifact's description?" If yes, create it. Do not invent — extract only what is implemented.

### Optional Artifacts — Explicit Consideration

When creating or editing a graph node, or mapping source files to a node, after fulfilling required artifacts, read \`config.yaml\` and for each artifact with \`required: never\`, ask: "Does this node contain content that matches this artifact's description?" If yes, create it. Base decisions on source code analysis, not file names or structure.

**Interpretation of \`required: never\`:** The artifact is optional for validation, not forbidden. Create it when the node has content that fits its description in config.

**Interpretation of "don't be over-eager":** Do not invent content, do not document what is not in the code, do not create empty or trivial artifacts. It does NOT mean: avoid adding optional artifacts when they add value based on code analysis.

**Post-node checklist:** After completing work on a node, for each optional artifact (from \`config.artifacts\` where \`required: never\`), check: does this node have content for it? If yes, create it. If uncertain, propose with brief justification rather than silently skipping.

### Layer 2: Surroundings (Relations & Flows)
* **What goes here:** How this node interacts with others. You must not duplicate external interfaces locally.
* **Routing:**
  * If it calls another module: Add an outgoing structural \`relation\` in \`node.yaml\`. (The engine will automatically fetch the target's structural-context artifacts: responsibility, interface, constraints, errors).
  * If it participates in an end-to-end process: Do not explain the whole process locally. Ensure the node is listed in \`.yggdrasil/flows/<flow_name>/flow.yaml\`. The engine will attach the flow knowledge automatically.
* **Flows — writing flow content:** When creating or editing flow artifacts (e.g. \`description.md\` in \`flows/<name>/\`), write business-first: describe the process from user/business perspective. Technical details only as inserts when they clarify the flow. Not technical-first with business inserts.

### Layer 3: Domain Context (Hierarchy)
* **What goes here:** Business rules shared by a family of nodes.
* **Routing:** Do not repeat module-wide rules in every child node. Place the child node directory *inside* a parent Module Node directory. Write the shared rules in the parent's configured artifacts. The engine inherently passes parent context to children.

### Layer 4: Cross-Cutting Rules (Aspects)
* **What goes here:** Horizontal requirements like logging, auth, rate-limiting, or specific frameworks.
* **Routing:** Do NOT write generic rules like "This node must log all errors" in local artifacts. Instead, read \`config.yaml\` for available \`tags\`. Add the relevant tag (e.g., \`requires-audit\`) to \`node.yaml\`. The engine will automatically attach the aspect knowledge.

### Layer 5: Long-Term Memory (Knowledge Elements)
* **What goes here:** Global architectural decisions, design patterns, and systemic invariants.
* **Routing:** Read \`config.yaml\` (the \`knowledge_categories\` section) to know what categories exist.
  * If the file implements a standard pattern: Do not describe the pattern locally. Add a \`knowledge\` reference in \`node.yaml\` to the existing pattern.
  * If the file reveals an undocumented global invariant or decision: Ask the user to confirm it. If confirmed, create it under \`.yggdrasil/knowledge/<category>/\` so all future nodes inherit it.

**THE COMPLETENESS CHECK:**
Before finishing a mapping, ask yourself: *"If I delete the source file and give another agent ONLY the output of \`yg build-context\`, can they recreate it perfectly based on the configured artifacts, AND will they understand EXACTLY WHY this code exists and why it was designed this way?"*
- If no -> You missed a local constraint, a relation, or you failed to capture the user's provided rationale.
- If yes, but the local files are bloated -> You failed to deconstruct knowledge into Tags, Aspects, Flows, and Hierarchy. Fix the routing.
