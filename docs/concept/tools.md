# Tools

## What this document is

The [Foundation](foundation) document defines the problem and invariants. The [Graph](graph) document defines the
structure of semantic memory. The [Engine](engine) document defines deterministic mechanics.
The [Integration](integration) document defines the behavioral contract with agents. The [Materialization](materialization)
document defines how context becomes output.

This document defines **formal contracts** — graph file schemas and tool operation
specifications.

Everything described here is implementable literally. Schemas define what files exist and
what they contain. Operations define what parameters they take, what they do, and what they
return. Two sides of the same system: schemas are data, operations are functions on that data.

## File schemas

### yg-config.yaml

The configuration file in the graph root directory. The single source of truth for what
tools expect and enforce.

```yaml
name: my-project # string, required

node_types: # object, required, non-empty — keys are type names
  module:
    description: "Business logic unit with clear domain responsibility"
  service:
    description: "Component providing functionality to other nodes"
  library:
    description: "Shared utility code with no domain knowledge"
  infrastructure:
    description: "Guards, middleware, interceptors — invisible in call graphs but affect blast radius"
    # required_aspects: [requires-audit]  # optional — aspects every node of this type must have

artifacts: # map, required, non-empty — keys are full filenames (e.g. responsibility.md, api.txt)
  responsibility.md:
    required: always # always | never | {when: <condition>}
    description: "What this node is responsible for, and what it is not"
    included_in_relations: true # optional, default false — include in dependency context for structural relations

  interface.md:
    required:
      when: has_incoming_relations # structural condition
    description: "Public API — methods, parameters, return types, contracts, failure modes, exposed data structures"
    included_in_relations: true

  internals.md:
    required: never
    description: "How the node works and why — algorithms, business rules, state machines, design decisions with rejected alternatives"

quality: # map, optional (has default values) — all keys snake_case
  min_artifact_length: 50 # int, default 50
  max_direct_relations: 10 # int, default 10
  context_budget:
    warning: 10000 # int, default 10000 (tokens)
    error: 20000 # int, default 20000 (tokens)
    own_warning: 5000 # int, optional (tokens) — warn when own artifacts alone exceed this
```

**Artifact requirement conditions:**

| `required` value               | Meaning                                                         |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `always`                       | Every non-blackbox node must have this artifact                 |
| `never`                        | Artifact is always optional                                     |
| `when: has_incoming_relations` | Required when there is a relation from another node to this one |
| `when: has_outgoing_relations` | Required when this node has relations to others                 |
| `when: has_aspect:<name>`      | Required when the node carries the specified aspect             |

**Validation rules for yg-config.yaml:**

- `name` must be non-empty.
- `node_types` must be a non-empty object. Each entry must have a `description` string. Optional `required_aspects` list. Node `type` must match a key in `node_types`.
- `artifacts` must contain at least one element.
- Artifact filenames cannot be `yg-node.yaml` (reserved in every node directory).
- `has_aspect:<name>` conditions must refer to aspect directory names (exist under `aspects/<name>/`).
- `quality.context_budget.error` must be ≥ `quality.context_budget.warning`.

### yg-node.yaml

Node identity and all its outgoing connections.

```yaml
name: OrderService # string, required
type: service # string, required — from config.node_types
aspects: # list of objects, optional — unified aspect entries
  - aspect: requires-audit # string, required — aspect identifier (directory path under aspects/)
    exceptions: # list of strings, optional — per-node deviations from this aspect's pattern
      - "Batch import skips per-record audit — emits single summary event instead"
    anchors: [auditLog, createAuditEntry] # list of strings, optional — code patterns for staleness detection
  - aspect: requires-auth # minimal entry — just the aspect identifier
blackbox: false # bool, optional, default false

relations: # list, optional
  - target: payments/payment-service # string, required — path relative to model/
    type: calls # string, required — relation type (see table)
    consumes: [charge, refund] # list of strings, optional
    failure: "retry 3x, then payment-failed" # string, optional
    # For event relations (emits, listens): event_name (optional) — display name, e.g. OrderPlaced

mapping: # map, optional
  paths: # list of strings, required when mapping is present
    - src/modules/orders/order.service.ts
```

**Relation types:**

| Type         | Class      | Acyclicity | Meaning                                   |
| ------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `uses`       | structural | required   | Uses functionality provided by the target |
| `calls`      | structural | required   | Calls the target's interface              |
| `extends`    | structural | required   | Extends the target                        |
| `implements` | structural | required   | Implements the target's contract          |
| `emits`      | event      | no         | Produces an event                         |
| `listens`    | event      | no         | Reacts to an event                        |

`mapping.paths` is a list of file and/or directory paths relative to project root. Files and
directories are auto-detected at runtime. Each path in the list is hashed individually — files
are hashed directly, directories are scanned recursively (respecting `.gitignore`).

**Validation rules for yg-node.yaml:**

- `name` must be non-empty.
- `type` must be a key in `config.node_types`.
- Each aspect entry's `aspect` identifier must correspond to a directory under `aspects/`.
- Each `relations[].target` must resolve to an existing node.
- Each `relations[].type` must be from the table above.
- Paths in `mapping.paths` must be relative to the repository root.
- `mapping.paths` must be non-empty when `mapping` is present.
- Mappings cannot overlap with mappings of other nodes.
- `anchors` within an aspect entry, if present, must be a non-empty array of strings.
- Anchor strings are validated against mapped source files: if an anchor is not found, a warning (W014) is emitted.

### yg-aspect.yaml

Aspect metadata — a cross-cutting requirement. The aspect identifier is the relative directory
path under `aspects/` (e.g. `aspects/requires-audit/` has identifier `requires-audit`;
`aspects/observability/logging/` has identifier `observability/logging`).

```yaml
name: Audit logging # string, required
description: "Short description for discovery" # string, optional
implies: [requires-logging] # list of strings, optional — ids of other aspects
stability: protocol # string, optional — schema | protocol | implementation
```

Nested directories under `aspects/` are organizational groupings. There is no automatic
parent-child relationship from nesting — `implies` is always explicit.

All files in the aspect directory except `yg-aspect.yaml` are content attached to the context
packages of nodes carrying the specified aspect. When `implies` is present, the aspect's content
plus all implied aspects' content is attached. Tools resolve implications recursively and detect cycles.

**Stability tiers:**

| `stability` value | Meaning                                                         |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schema`          | Enforced by data model; changes require migration (most stable) |
| `protocol`        | Contractual pattern; breaking causes visible failures           |
| `implementation`  | Specific mechanism; subject to optimization (least stable)      |

**Validation rules:**

- `name` must be non-empty.
- Every identifier in `implies` must have a corresponding aspect directory under `aspects/`.
- The aspect implies graph must be acyclic (no A implies B implies A).
- `stability`, if present, must be one of: `schema`, `protocol`, `implementation`.

### yg-flow.yaml

End-to-end flow metadata.

```yaml
name: Checkout flow # string, required
nodes: # list of strings, required, non-empty
  - orders/order-service # path relative to model/
  - payments/payment-service
aspects: # list of strings, optional — aspect ids propagated to all participants
  - requires-saga
  - requires-idempotency
```

All files in the flow directory except `yg-flow.yaml` are content attached to the context
packages of the listed nodes and their descendants (flows propagate down the hierarchy).
Aspects declared in `aspects` propagate to all participants.

**Validation rules:**

- `name` must be non-empty.
- `nodes` must be non-empty.
- Each element in `nodes[]` must resolve to an existing node.
- Each aspect identifier in `aspects[]` (if present) must correspond to an aspect directory under `aspects/`.

### description.md

Primary flow content artifact — describes the business process. Required for every flow.

**Required sections (H2):**

- `## Business context` — why this process exists
- `## Trigger` — what initiates the process
- `## Goal` — what success looks like
- `## Participants` — nodes involved (align with `yg-flow.yaml` nodes)
- `## Paths` — must contain at least `### Happy path`; each additional business path (exception, cancellation, timeout) gets `### [name]`
- `## Invariants across all paths` — business rules and technical conditions holding across all paths

Note: section validation is not yet enforced by `yg validate`.

One flow directory = one business process with all its paths (happy path, exceptions, cancellations).

### schemas/

The `schemas/` directory contains schema files — one per graph layer. Initialization copies
`yg-node.yaml`, `yg-aspect.yaml`, and `yg-flow.yaml` from the CLI package. Each file
shows the expected YAML structure for its element type. The agent reads the schema before
creating or editing that element (see the [Graph](graph) document, Schemas section).

| File              | Element type | Describes structure of                    |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `yg-node.yaml`   | Nodes        | `yg-node.yaml` in model directories        |
| `yg-aspect.yaml` | Aspects      | `yg-aspect.yaml` in aspects directories    |
| `yg-flow.yaml`   | Flows        | `yg-flow.yaml` in flows directories        |

### .drift-state/

Synchronization state between the graph and all tracked files (source and graph artifacts).
Managed exclusively by tools — agents and humans do not edit it. Stored as a directory of
per-node JSON files at `.yggdrasil/.drift-state/`.

Committed to the repository (shared in the team, usable in CI pipelines).

Each node gets its own file at `.drift-state/<node-path>.json`. For example, a node at
`model/cli/commands/aspects/` stores its drift state at
`.drift-state/cli/commands/aspects.json`.

```json
{
  "hash": "a1b2c3d4e5f6...",
  "files": {
    "src/modules/orders/order.service.ts": "1111...",
    "src/modules/orders/order.repository.ts": "2222...",
    ".yggdrasil/model/orders/order-service/yg-node.yaml": "3333...",
    ".yggdrasil/model/orders/order-service/responsibility.md": "4444...",
    ".yggdrasil/aspects/requires-audit/yg-aspect.yaml": "5555..."
  },
  "mtimes": {
    "src/modules/orders/order.service.ts": 1709731200000,
    "src/modules/orders/order.repository.ts": 1709731200000
  }
}
```

**Format per file:** a JSON object with:

- `hash` (required) — canonical SHA-256 hash of all tracked files (source + graph).
- `files` (required) — map `file_path -> file_hash` for all tracked files. Includes both
  source paths (from `mapping.paths`) and `.yggdrasil/` graph paths (node artifacts,
  ancestor artifacts, aspect files, flow files, relation target artifacts — mirroring the
  context assembly traversal). Enables drift detection to report exactly which files changed
  and whether they are source or graph files.
- `mtimes` (optional) — map `file_path -> timestamp` for mtime-based optimization. When
  present, drift detection can skip re-hashing files whose mtime has not changed.

The `files` map always contains every tracked file for the node. Source files come from the
node's mapping. Graph files come from the `collectTrackedFiles` algorithm, which mirrors
the six layers of tracked file collection (own, hierarchical, aspects, relational dependencies,
relational flows, source). See the [Engine](engine) document for details.

Each path in `mapping.paths` is checked at runtime — if it is a file, it is hashed directly
(SHA-256 of file content); if it is a directory, it is scanned recursively (respecting
`.gitignore`), each file is hashed, and a canonical hash is computed from sorted path:hash
pairs. The overall canonical `hash` combines all tracked file hashes (source + graph) into a
single value.

**Legacy migration:** If a single `.drift-state` file (the previous format) is found instead
of the `.drift-state/` directory, it is migrated automatically on first read — each node
entry is written to its own JSON file under `.drift-state/`.

**Garbage collection:** When `drift-sync --all` runs, orphaned drift state files (files
under `.drift-state/` that no longer correspond to a mapped node) are removed.

---

## Operations

Each operation is described by its purpose, parameters, step-by-step behavior, result, and
error conditions. Operations do not modify semantic content in the graph — they only create, read,
or modify operational metadata (`.yggdrasil/.drift-state/`). The only exception is
initialization, which creates the starting structure.

### Naming convention

Operations are invoked as tool commands with the `yg` prefix:

```text
yg init --platform cursor
yg init --platform cursor --upgrade   # refreshes rules when .yggdrasil/ exists
yg build-context --node orders/order-service
yg tree
yg aspects
yg status
yg preflight
yg owner --file src/modules/orders/order.service.ts
yg deps --node orders/order-service
yg impact --node payments/payment-service --simulate
yg validate
yg drift
yg drift-sync --node orders/order-service
```

Command names correspond to the section headers below. Parameters passed via flags
(`--node`, `--file`, `--simulate`, etc.) or positionally are an implementation decision,
not a specification. The examples above illustrate intent, not syntax.

---

### Init

Creates the `.yggdrasil/` structure with default configuration and agent platform integration.
Full initialization — once per repository.
Upgrade mode — refreshes only the rules file (when `.yggdrasil/` already exists).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter  | Type   | Required | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `platform` | string | No       | Agent platform: `cursor`, `claude-code`, `copilot`, `cline`, `roocode`, `codex`, `windsurf`, `aider`, `gemini`, `amp`, `generic`. Default: `generic`. |
| `upgrade`  | bool   | No       | If `true` and `.yggdrasil/` exists — overwrite only the rules file. Do not modify config or graph. Use after CLI update.                              |

**Behavior:**

1. Check if `.yggdrasil/` exists. If it exists and `upgrade` is `false` — error. If it exists and `upgrade` is `true` — go to step 5.
2. Create directory structure:

   ```text
   .yggdrasil/
   ├── yg-config.yaml
   ├── .gitignore
   ├── model/
   ├── aspects/
   ├── flows/
   └── schemas/
   ```

3. Write `yg-config.yaml` with default content (see Default configuration below).
4. Write `.yggdrasil/.gitignore` (with entries for local operational files).

5. Run migrations (upgrade mode only):

   a. Read `version` from `yg-config.yaml`. If absent, treat as `1.0.0`.

   b. If project version equals CLI version — skip migrations, proceed to step 6.

   c. If project version is newer than CLI version — print a warning and exit without
      modifying any files.

   d. For each applicable migration (project version < migration version ≤ CLI version),
      run in order. Each action prints with a `✓` prefix on success or a `⚠` prefix on
      warning/skip.

   e. After all migrations complete, write the updated `version` to `yg-config.yaml`.

6. Generate the platform rules file in the location appropriate for the `platform` parameter
   (see Platform rules file section).

**Result:**

- Full initialization: list of created files and directories.
- Upgrade mode: path of the refreshed rules file and list of migration actions applied.

**Errors:**

- `.yggdrasil/` already exists and `upgrade` was not provided — full init is a one-time operation.
- Project version is newer than CLI version — user must upgrade the CLI before running `--upgrade`.

**Default configuration:**

```yaml
name: ""

node_types:
  module:
    description: "Business logic unit with clear domain responsibility"
  service:
    description: "Component providing functionality to other nodes"
  library:
    description: "Shared utility code with no domain knowledge"
  infrastructure:
    description: "Guards, middleware, interceptors — invisible in call graphs but affect blast radius"

artifacts:
  responsibility.md:
    required: always
    description: "What this node is responsible for, and what it is not"
    included_in_relations: true
  interface.md:
    required:
      when: has_incoming_relations
    description: "Public API — methods, parameters, return types, contracts, failure modes, exposed data structures"
    included_in_relations: true
  internals.md:
    required: never
    description: "How the node works and why — algorithms, business rules, state machines, design decisions with rejected alternatives"

quality:
  min_artifact_length: 50
  max_direct_relations: 10
  context_budget:
    warning: 10000
    error: 20000
    # own_warning: 5000  # optional — warn when own artifacts alone exceed this
```

The agent fills in `name` after initialization.
The tool does not guess this value.

**Note:** Until `name` is set (non-empty), most commands that load the graph will fail
with a config parse error. The user should edit `yg-config.yaml` before running
`yg validate`, `yg status`, `yg drift`, or other operations.

---

### Build context

Assemble a context package for the specified node. The main operation of the system.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                                        |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `node`    | string | Yes      | Node path relative to `model/`                                     |
| `--full`  | flag   | No       | Embed artifact content inline instead of listing paths only        |

**Behavior:**

The 5-step algorithm defined in the [Engine](engine) document. Summary:

1. **Global** — `yg-config.yaml` (project name).
2. **Hierarchical** — ancestor artifacts (from `model/` root down to the node's parent).
3. **Own** — the node's `yg-node.yaml` (raw) and content artifacts.
4. **Aspects** — union of aspect identifiers from hierarchy blocks, own block, and flow blocks (each block
   declares its own; no inheritance). Expand implies recursively. Render content of each
   matching aspect. No source attribute on aspect output.
5. **Relational** — for structural relations: artifacts with `included_in_relations: true`
   (default: responsibility, interface) of the target with consumes
   and failure annotations. If the target has no artifacts with `included_in_relations: true`,
   all configured artifacts are included as fallback. For each dependency, ancestors of the
   target node are included (dependency hierarchy) to provide domain context. For event
   relations: event name and type with consumes annotation. Flow artifacts for flows listing
   this node or any ancestor as a participant.

Token estimation: ~4 characters per token (heuristic from the [Engine](engine) document).

**Result:**

YAML with structural map and artifact paths (default) or artifact content (`--full`), as
defined in the [Engine](engine) document (Context package format section). Includes token count
and budget status (`ok`, `warning`, `severe`).

**Errors:**

- Node does not exist at the provided path.
- The graph has any validation errors. Assembly requires a consistent graph — the tool
  reports errors and refuses to assemble.

---

### Tree view

Displays the graph structure as a tree with node metadata.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                                 |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `root`    | string | No       | Root path (relative to `model/`). Default: entire `model/`. |
| `depth`   | int    | No       | Maximum depth. Default: unlimited.                          |

**Behavior:**

1. Traverse the directory tree from the root.
2. For each directory with a `yg-node.yaml` — read metadata.
3. Build a tree representation.

**Result:**

```text
model/
├── auth/ [module] -> 0 relations
│   ├── login-service/ [service] aspects:requires-auth -> 1 relations
│   └── token-service/ [service] -> 0 relations
├── orders/ [module] -> 0 relations
│   └── order-service/ [service] aspects:requires-audit,requires-auth -> 2 relations
└── payments/ [module] ■ blackbox -> 0 relations
    └── payment-service/ [service] ■ blackbox -> 0 relations
```

Format: path, type in brackets, aspects (if any), blackbox flag (if true), number of outgoing relations.

**Errors:**

- The provided root does not exist.

---

### Aspects

Lists aspects with metadata in YAML format. Use to discover valid aspect identifiers for
`yg-node.yaml` and `yg-flow.yaml`.

**Parameters:** none.

**Behavior:**

1. Resolve `.yggdrasil/` root (repository root or nearest parent).
2. Load the graph — find all aspect directories under `.yggdrasil/aspects/` (including nested).
3. Sort by aspect identifier.
4. Output YAML with `id`, `name`, `description` (if present), `implies` (if present), `stability` (if present).

**Result:**

```yaml
- id: deterministic
  name: Determinism
  stability: schema
- id: observability/logging
  name: Audit Logging
  description: Every state-changing operation must produce an audit log entry
  implies:
    - observability/tracing
  stability: protocol
```

**Errors:**

- No `.yggdrasil/` directory — exit 1.
- If no `aspects/` directory exists, outputs an empty list.

---

### Flows

Lists flows with metadata in YAML format. Use to discover defined business processes,
their participants, and associated aspects.

**Parameters:** none.

**Behavior:**

1. Resolve `.yggdrasil/` root (repository root or nearest parent).
2. Load the graph — find all flow directories under `.yggdrasil/flows/`.
3. Sort by flow name.
4. Output YAML with `name`, `nodes` (participants), `aspects` (if present).

**Result:**

```yaml
- name: Checkout Flow
  nodes:
    - orders/order-service
    - auth/auth-api
  aspects:
    - requires-audit
```

**Errors:**

- No `.yggdrasil/` directory — exit 1.
- If no `flows/` directory exists, outputs an empty list.

---

### Status

Summary of the graph state: numbers, metrics, problems.

**Parameters:** none.

**Behavior:**

1. Count nodes (broken down by types and blackbox/non-blackbox).
2. Count relations (broken down by structural/event).
3. Count aspects and flows.
4. Read drift state for mapped nodes.
5. Run validation (only counting errors and warnings, without full messages).
6. Compute quality metrics: artifact fill rate, relation distribution, mapping coverage,
   aspect coverage.

**Result:**

```text
Graph: my-project
Nodes: 12 (3 modules, 7 services, 2 libraries) + 2 blackbox
Relations: 15 structural, 4 event
Aspects: 3    Flows: 2
Drift: 1 source-drift, 1 graph-drift, 0 full-drift, 1 missing, 2 unmaterialized, 7 ok
Validation: 0 errors, 3 warnings

Quality:
  Artifacts: 42/96 slots filled (44%) — 8 types × 12 nodes
  Relations: avg 1.6/node, max 5 (orders/order-service)
  Mapping: 10/12 nodes mapped to source
  Aspects: 8/12 nodes have aspect coverage
```

**Errors:**

- No `.yggdrasil/` — repository is not initialized.
- Invalid `yg-config.yaml` — configuration cannot be parsed.

---

### Preflight

Unified diagnostic combining drift detection, graph status, and validation.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description                                           |
| --------- | ---- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `quick`   | bool | No       | Skip drift detection for faster results. Default: `false`. |

**Behavior:**

1. Unless `--quick`: run `drift --drifted-only` — report nodes with source or graph drift (any drift contributes to exit code 1). When `--quick`, output "Drift: skipped (--quick)".
2. Run `status` — report graph health (node, aspect, flow, and mapping counts).
3. Run `validate` — report structural errors and completeness warnings (any errors contribute to exit code 1).

**Result:**

```text
Drift:
  orders/order-service source-drift

Graph: my-project
Nodes: 12 (3 modules, 7 services, 2 libraries) + 2 blackbox
Relations: 15 structural, 4 event
Aspects: 3    Flows: 2
Drift: 1 source-drift, 0 graph-drift, 0 full-drift, 0 missing, 0 unmaterialized, 11 ok
Validation: 0 errors, 3 warnings
```

**Exit codes:**

- `0` — fully clean: no drift, no validation errors.
- `1` — one or more of: drifted nodes, validation errors.

**Errors:**

- No `.yggdrasil/` — repository is not initialized.

---

### Node selection

Finds graph nodes relevant to a natural-language task description.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter     | Type   | Required | Description                                     |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `task`        | string | Yes      | Natural-language task description               |
| `limit`       | number | No       | Maximum nodes to return. Default: `5`.          |

**Behavior:**

1. Tokenize the task description: lowercase, split on non-alphanumeric, remove stop words.
2. **S1 (keyword matching):** For each node, score keyword hits against artifact content with
   weights: `responsibility.md` x3, `interface.md` x2, aspect content x2, other artifacts x1.
3. If any node scores above 0: sort by score descending, return top-K.
4. **S2 (flow-based fallback):** If no node matched via S1, match tokens against flow
   descriptions and names. Return participants of matching flows.

**Result:**

YAML list of `{ node, score, name }` sorted by relevance. Empty list when nothing matches.

```yaml
- node: orders/order-service
  score: 12
  name: OrderService
- node: orders
  score: 6
  name: Orders
```

**Errors:**

- No `.yggdrasil/` — repository is not initialized.
- Empty `--task` — missing required option.

---

### Ownership resolution

Finds the owner node for a given file path.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                               |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `file`    | string | Yes      | File path relative to the repository root |

**Behavior:**

1. Traverse all nodes with a mapping.
2. For each mapping, check if the file matches any entry in `mapping.paths` — either the
   path equals a file entry, or the file lies inside a directory entry.
3. Return the first matching node (uniqueness is guaranteed by validation — mapping overlaps
   are errors).

**Result:**

Owner node path or information about missing coverage.

```text
src/modules/orders/order.service.ts -> orders/order-service
```

When the file has no direct mapping but lies inside a mapped directory, the output includes an
additional line explaining that context comes from the nearest ancestor directory and suggests
how to obtain it:

```text
src/modules/orders/subdir/helper.ts -> orders/order-service
  File has no direct mapping; context comes from ancestor directory src/modules/orders. Use: yg build-context --node orders/order-service
```

```text
src/utils/helpers.ts -> no graph coverage
```

**Uncovered file (no owner):** The tool returns "no graph coverage". For the agent: STOP. First determine whether the area is **greenfield**, **partially mapped**, or **existing code**.

- **If GREENFIELD** (empty directory, new project): Do NOT offer blackbox. Create proper nodes (reverse engineering or upfront design) before implementing. Blackbox is forbidden for new code.
- **If PARTIALLY MAPPED** (file unmapped but lives inside a mapped module): Stop and ask the user if this file should be added to the existing node or if a new node is required.
- **If EXISTING CODE** (legacy, third-party, shipped-but-unmapped): Present three options and wait for the user to choose:
  - **Option A — Reverse engineering (full coverage):** Create or extend nodes so the file becomes owned. Then continue.
  - **Option B — Blackbox coverage:** Create a blackbox node at user-chosen granularity (often a higher-level directory/module). Ensure the file becomes owned by that blackbox mapping. Then continue.
  - **Option C — Abort/Change plan:** Do not touch the file until coverage is decided.

If the file path does not exist on disk, the output includes a `(file not found)` hint to
distinguish from files that exist but lack graph coverage.

**Errors:**

- None — the operation always returns a result (a node or no coverage).

### Dependency analysis

Shows node dependencies — direct and transitive.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter | Type   | Required | Description                                                          |
| --------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`    | string | Yes      | Node path relative to `model/`                                       |
| `depth`   | int    | No       | Transitive depth. Default: unlimited.                                |
| `type`    | string | No       | Relation class filter: `structural`, `event`, `all`. Default: `all`. |

**Behavior:**

1. Read node relations.
2. Recursively follow outgoing relations up to the specified depth.
3. Build a dependency tree.

**Result:**

```text
orders/order-service
├── calls payments/payment-service
│   └── calls stripe/stripe-gateway ■ blackbox
├── calls inventory/inventory-service
└── emits notifications/notification-service
```

**Errors:**

- Node does not exist.

---

### Impact analysis

Shows the blast radius of changes to a node, aspect, or flow. Supports three
mutually exclusive modes and an optional simulation pass.

**Parameters:**

| Parameter  | Type   | Required              | Description                                                       |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`     | string | One of three required | Node path relative to `model/`                                    |
| `aspect`   | string | One of three required | Aspect id (directory path under `aspects/`)                       |
| `flow`     | string | One of three required | Flow name (directory name under `flows/`)                         |
| `method`   | string | No                    | Filter dependents to those consuming this method (node mode only) |
| `simulate` | bool   | No                    | Whether to simulate impact on context packages. Default: `false`. |

Exactly one of `node`, `aspect`, or `flow` must be provided.

#### Node mode (`--node`)

1. Find all nodes whose structural relations point to the target (reverse graph edge).
2. If `--method` is specified, filter direct dependents to those whose `consumes` list includes the method (or have no `consumes` specified, meaning they consume everything).
3. Recursively follow reverse edges (transitive reverse dependencies).
4. Collect descendants of the target node (hierarchy impact).
5. Collect indirect structural dependents of descendants — nodes that depend on descendants via structural or event relations (uses/calls/extends/implements/emits/listens) but are not already shown.
6. Find flows listing the target node.
7. Compute effective aspects (own + hierarchy + flow + implies).
8. Find co-aspect nodes sharing any aspect with the target.
9. Find event-related nodes: nodes with `emits`/`listens` relations targeting the node, and listeners of events the target node emits.

```text
Impact of changes in payments/payment-service:

Directly dependent:
  <- orders/order-service (calls, you consume: charge, refund)
  <- subscriptions/billing-service (calls, you consume: charge)

Transitively dependent:
  <- orders/order-service <- checkout/checkout-controller

Event-dependent:
  <- notifications/email-service (listens: PaymentCompleted)

Descendants (hierarchy impact):
  payments/payment-service/stripe-adapter

Indirectly affected (structural dependents of descendants):
  <- reports/adapter-monitor <- payments/payment-service/stripe-adapter

Flows: checkout
Aspects (scope covers node): requires-saga, requires-idempotency
Nodes sharing aspects:
  orders/order-service (requires-saga, requires-idempotency)

Total scope: 6 nodes, 1 flows, 2 aspects
```

#### Aspect mode (`--aspect`)

1. For every node, compute effective aspects (own + hierarchy + flow + implies).
2. Collect all nodes where the specified aspect is effective (directly affected).
3. Report source of the aspect for each node: own, hierarchy, flow, or implied.
4. Collect indirect structural dependents — nodes that depend on directly affected nodes via structural or event relations (uses/calls/extends/implements/emits/listens) but are not themselves directly affected.
5. List flows propagating this aspect and implies relationships.

```text
Impact of changes in aspect requires-audit:

Directly affected (3):
  orders (own)
  orders/order-service (hierarchy from orders)
  payments/payment-service (flow: checkout)

Indirectly affected (structural dependents):
  <- checkout/checkout-controller <- orders/order-service

Flows propagating this aspect: (none)
Implied by: (none)
Implies: (none)

Total scope: 4 nodes, 0 flows
```

#### Flow mode (`--flow`)

1. List all declared participants.
2. Expand each participant's descendants (hierarchy impact).
3. Collect indirect structural dependents — nodes that depend on participants via structural or event relations (uses/calls/extends/implements/emits/listens) but are not themselves participants.
4. Report flow-level aspects.

```text
Impact of changes in flow Checkout Flow:

Participants:
  auth/auth-api
  orders/order-service
  payments/payment-service
  payments/payment-service/stripe-adapter (descendant)

Indirectly affected (structural dependents):
  <- checkout/checkout-controller <- orders/order-service

Flow aspects: requires-saga

Total scope: 5 nodes
```

#### Simulation mode (`--simulate`)

Available with any mode. For each affected node:

1. Assemble a context package in the current graph state.
2. Assemble a baseline context package from the HEAD commit.
3. Report token budget shift (baseline → current) with ok/warning/error status.
4. In node mode, flag nodes with a changed dependency interface to the target.
5. Report drift status of mapped source files.

```text
Changes in context packages:

orders/order-service:
  + Changed dependency interface: payments/payment-service
  Budget: 3200 -> 3450 tokens (ok)
  Mapped files (on-disk): ok

subscriptions/billing-service:
  + Changed dependency interface: payments/payment-service
  Budget: 2800 -> 3050 tokens (ok)
  Mapped files (on-disk): drift (Changed files: src/billing/charge.ts)
```

**Errors:**

- Node / aspect / flow does not exist.
- Multiple modes specified (mutually exclusive).
- No mode specified.

**Message format:**

```text
E004 orders/order-service -> relation to 'payment/svc' does not resolve.
     Existing nodes in payments/: payment-service
     Did you mean 'payments/payment-service'?

W001 orders/order-service -> missing artifact 'interface'.
     Node has 3 incoming relations: auth/login-service, checkout/controller,
     subscriptions/billing-service. Define the public API in interface.md.

W005 orders/order-service -> context: ~15,200 tokens (warning: 10,000)
     own: 3,100 (20%) | hierarchy: 4,800 (32%) | aspects: 4,200 (28%) |
     flows: 1,600 (10%) | dependencies: 1,500 (10%)
```

Messages are **contextual and actionable** — not just "error", but what is wrong,
why, and what to do (see the [Integration](integration) document).

**Result:**

A list of messages grouped: errors first, then warnings.
Summary at the end: X errors, Y warnings.

**Exit code:** 0 if no errors, 1 if any errors found.

**Operation errors:**

- The specified node in `scope` does not exist.
- `yg-config.yaml` fails to parse (reported as E012, not as an operation error — validation
  continues as much as it can).

---

### Drift

Detect divergences between the graph and tracked files (source + graph artifacts).
Drift detection is bidirectional — it tracks changes on both the source side (mapped files)
and the graph side (`.yggdrasil/` artifacts that contribute to the node's context package).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter      | Type   | Required | Description                                                       |
| -------------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `scope`        | string | No       | `all` or node path. When a node path is given, includes all descendant nodes. Default: `all`. |
| `drifted-only` | bool   | No       | Hide `ok` entries; show only nodes with drift. Default: `false`.  |
| `limit`        | number | No       | Max entries per section. Truncated sections show remaining count. |

**Behavior:**

1. For each mapped node (in scope):
   a. Check if mapped source files exist on disk.
   b. Collect all tracked files for the node (source files from mapping + graph artifact
      files from context assembly traversal) via `collectTrackedFiles`.
   c. Compute hashes for all tracked files and compare with the baseline in
      `.yggdrasil/.drift-state/`.
   d. Classify each changed file as `source` or `graph` based on whether its path is under
      `.yggdrasil/`.
   e. Assign state: `ok`, `source-drift`, `graph-drift`, `full-drift`, `missing`,
      `unmaterialized`.

**States:**

| State            | Condition                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ok`             | All tracked file hashes match — nothing changed since synchronization                       |
| `source-drift`   | Source file(s) changed but graph artifacts unchanged                                        |
| `graph-drift`    | Graph artifact(s) changed but source files unchanged                                        |
| `full-drift`     | Both source and graph files changed                                                         |
| `missing`        | Mapped source files do not exist on disk, but a hash exists in `.drift-state/`              |
| `unmaterialized` | Node has a mapping, but files have never been created (no entry in `.drift-state/`)          |

If a node has no drift-state entry but its files exist on disk, it reports `source-drift`
with a note to run `drift-sync`.

**Result:**

Output is organized in two sections — Source drift and Graph drift. Nodes appear in the
section(s) relevant to their drift type. `full-drift` nodes appear in both sections.

```text
Source drift:
  [drift]      orders/order-service
               src/modules/orders/order.service.ts  (changed)
  [missing]    auth/token-service
  [unmat.]     notifications/email-service
  [ok]         payments/payment-service

Graph drift:
  [drift]      orders/order-service
               .yggdrasil/model/orders/order-service/responsibility.md  (changed)
  [ok]         payments/payment-service

Summary: 1 source-drift, 0 graph-drift, 1 full-drift, 1 missing, 1 unmaterialized, 1 ok
```

With `--drifted-only`, `ok` entries are hidden and the summary shows the count of hidden
entries.

Changed files are listed per-section — the Source drift section shows only changed source
files, the Graph drift section shows only changed graph files.

**Exit code:** 0 if all nodes are `ok`, 1 if any drift/missing/unmaterialized entries exist.

**Errors:**

- Specified node does not exist.
- Node has no mapping (does not participate in drift detection).

---

### Drift sync

Update the remembered hash for a node after resolving a divergence.
Called after the agent resolves drift (absorption or rejection + re-materialization).

**Parameters:**

| Parameter   | Type   | Required | Description                                                       |
| ----------- | ------ | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `node`      | string | No*      | Node path relative to `model/`. Required unless `--all` is used.  |
| `recursive` | bool   | No       | Also sync all descendant nodes. Default: `false`.                 |
| `all`       | bool   | No*      | Sync all nodes with mappings. Required unless `--node` is used.   |

**Behavior:**

1. Collect all tracked files for the node via `collectTrackedFiles` — this includes both
   source files (from `mapping.paths`) and graph artifact files (from the context assembly
   traversal: own node, ancestors, aspects, relational dependencies, flows).
2. Compute hashes for all tracked files.
3. Write the canonical hash and per-file hashes to `.yggdrasil/.drift-state/<node-path>.json`.

The operation captures the complete set of tracked files (source + graph), not just mapping
files. This enables subsequent drift detection to identify changes on either side.

The operation does not check _how_ the drift was resolved (that is the agent's and human's
decision). It records the current file state as the new baseline.

**Result:**

```text
Synchronized: orders/order-service
  Hash: a1b2c3d4 -> e5f6g7h8
```

**Errors:**

- Node does not exist.
- Node has no mapping.
- Mapped files do not exist (cannot calculate hash).

## Platform rules file

Initialization generates a rules file delivered via the agent platform's integration
mechanism. The location depends on the platform:

| Platform      | File                                                  | Delivery                       |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `cursor`      | `.cursor/rules/yggdrasil.mdc`                         | Embeds full rules content      |
| `claude-code` | `CLAUDE.md` (imports `.yggdrasil/agent-rules.md`)     | References `agent-rules.md`    |
| `copilot`     | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (Yggdrasil section) | Embeds full rules content      |
| `cline`       | `.clinerules/yggdrasil.md`                            | Embeds full rules content      |
| `roocode`     | `.roo/rules/yggdrasil.md`                             | Embeds full rules content      |
| `codex`       | `AGENTS.md` (Yggdrasil section)                       | Embeds full rules content      |
| `windsurf`    | `.windsurf/rules/yggdrasil.md`                        | Embeds full rules content      |
| `aider`       | `.aider.conf.yml` (adds `read:` entry)                | References `agent-rules.md`    |
| `gemini`      | `GEMINI.md` (imports `.yggdrasil/agent-rules.md`)     | References `agent-rules.md`    |
| `amp`         | `AGENTS.md` (imports `.yggdrasil/agent-rules.md`)     | References `agent-rules.md`    |
| `generic`     | `.yggdrasil/agent-rules.md`                           | Direct file                    |

The content is identical regardless of the platform — only the location and any wrapper
(frontmatter, section in an existing file, etc.) differ.

### Rules content

The canonical agent rules are delivered by the platform integration file generated from
`source/cli/src/templates/rules.ts`. The full prompt is not duplicated here — the spec
documents the behavioral contract; the implementation provides the canonical text.

**Behavioral model (no explicit "session"):**

- **Start of every conversation:** Preflight — (1) `yg drift --drifted-only` (reports source
  and graph drift — `source-drift`/`graph-drift`/`full-drift`/`missing`/`unmaterialized`),
  (2) `yg status` (report health), (3) `yg validate` (fix any errors, address warnings).
  _Exception:_ Read-only requests skip preflight.
- **User signals closing the topic** (e.g. "we're done", "wrap up", "that's enough", "done"):
  drift, validate, report exactly what nodes and files were changed.
- **Execution checklists:** Code-first (read spec → modify code → sync artifacts → baseline hash) and graph-first
  (read schema → edit graph → verify source → validate → baseline hash). Agent must output and execute before finishing.

The agent learns **how** from five sources: (1) rules file, (2) yg-config.yaml, (3) schemas/,
(4) existing graph nodes, (5) validation feedback. See the [Integration](integration) document.
