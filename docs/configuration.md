title: Configuration
---

Everything here is optional except the fields required by the schema.
Yggdrasil works out of the box with sensible defaults.

Config file: `.yggdrasil/config.yaml`

---

## Schema

### Required fields

- **name** — Project identity (non-empty string)
- **node_types** — Non-empty array of node types. Each element is a string (e.g. `module`, `service`) or an object `{ name, required_aspects? }`. `required_aspects` lists aspects that nodes of this type must have coverage for (directly or via aspect `implies`).
- **artifacts** — Non-empty object defining artifact types and their requirements

### Optional fields

- **stack** — Key-value metadata (e.g. `language`, `runtime`)
- **standards** — Project standards text (e.g. coding conventions)
- **quality** — Quality thresholds

---

## What you can customize

- **Node types** — The vocabulary of parts your repo uses (e.g. `module`, `service`, `library`). Optionally, each type can declare `required_aspects` — aspects that nodes of that type must have coverage for (directly or via aspect composition).
- **Artifacts** — The kinds of meaning you want to capture per node. Each artifact has:
  - `required`: `always` | `never` | `{ when: "has_incoming_relations" }`
  - `description`: string
- **Quality thresholds** — When to warn about shallow memory or large context

---

## Quality config

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `min_artifact_length` | 50 | Minimum chars for artifact content (shallow warning) |
| `max_direct_relations` | 10 | Max relations before high fan-out warning |
| `context_budget.warning` | 10000 | Token count warning threshold |
| `context_budget.error` | 20000 | Token count error threshold |

## Example

```yaml
name: my-repo

stack:
  language: TypeScript
  runtime: Node.js 22+

standards: |
  Strict TypeScript. ESM modules. Vitest for tests.

node_types:
  - module
  - service
  - library

artifacts:
  responsibility:
    required: always
    description: "What this node is responsible for, and what it is not"
  interface:
    required:
      when: has_incoming_relations
    description: "Public API — methods, parameters, return types, contracts"
  constraints:
    required: never
    description: "Validation rules, business rules, invariants"
  errors:
    required:
      when: has_incoming_relations
    description: "Error conditions, codes, recovery behavior"
  state:
    required: never
    description: "State machines, lifecycle, transitions"
  decisions:
    required: never
    description: "Local design decisions and rationale"

quality:
  min_artifact_length: 50
  max_direct_relations: 10
  context_budget:
    warning: 10000
    error: 20000
```

## Notes

- Artifact name `node` is reserved.
- `config.yaml: quality.context_budget.error` must be >= `context_budget.warning`.
